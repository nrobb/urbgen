UrbGen - procedural generation of urban environments
====================================================

UrbGen is a JavaScript library for the procedural generation of urban environments, primarily intended for use in WebGL and HTML Canvas game development. It can be used as a standalone library by downloading and including the script in your project. It can also be used via a web application, available at [urbgen.com](http://urbgen.com). The web application is compatible with any WebGL-enabled browser, but is best viewed in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

For more information, documentation, and developer guidelines, vist [urbgen.com](http://urbgen.com).

**Note** The UrbGen web application uses [dat.gui](https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui), which makes use of HTML5's window.localStorage object. Because of this, it is not possible to run the web application from a local file in Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you are intending to run the web application from a local file, please use either Chrome or Firefox. This obviously does not apply when the application is accessed via [urbgen.com](http://urbgen.com).
