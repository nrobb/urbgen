UrbGen - procedural generation of urban environments
====================================================

UrbGen is a JavaScript library for the procedural generation of urban environments, primarily intended for use in WebGL and HTML Canvas game development. It can be used as a library by downloading and including the script in your project. It can also be used via a web application, available at [urbgen.com](http://urbgen.com). The web application is compatible with any WebGL-enabled browser, but is best viewed in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. UrbGen was developed as a MSc Dissertation project at Queen's University Belfast.
